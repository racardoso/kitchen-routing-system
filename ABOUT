Problem #1 â€“ The Kitchen Routing System

Write down your assumptions whenever necessary for better understanding.

You are tasked with writing a piece of software to do a Restaurant Order Routing. Assume that you have
a restaurant with multiple POS (point-of-sale) instances sending orders that should be routed to specific
areas of a kitchen.

It must comprise a multi-thread safe dynamic library with:

- A function to receive an Order with multiple products and place it in a queue representing a
destination kitchen area;
- A function to receive the list of products in a Kitchen area;
- A function to remove and return the first product from a Kitchen area;
- A simple application, console or graphical to test the dynamic library.

Create a C++ solution in Visual Studio.

We really encourage you to write down any assumptions you had as comments on the top of your code
for better understanding.

Requirements:
- The application must be executable in Windows machines;
- You don't have to worry about databases; it&#39;s fine to use in-process, in-memory storage;
- It must be production quality according to your understanding of it - README, etc.
